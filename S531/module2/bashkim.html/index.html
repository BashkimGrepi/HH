    <h1>No man is an island </h1>
    <h2>poem by <cite>John Donne</cite></h2>
    
    <blockquote> <i>No man is an island,
        Entire of itself,<br>
        Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
        A part of the main. <br>
        If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br>
        Europe is the less. <br>
        As well as if a promontory were. <br>
        As well as if a manor of thy friend's <br>
        Or of thine own were: <br>
        Any man's death diminishes me, <br>
        Because I am involved in mankind, <br>
        And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>
        It tolls for thee.</i></blockquote>
